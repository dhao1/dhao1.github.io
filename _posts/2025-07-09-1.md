We make plans.  
We draw timelines.  
We picture outcomes.  
And we fall in love with the story we created in our mind.

But life?  
Life doesn’t read your script.

It improvises.  
It surprises.  
It interrupts with no apology.

Suddenly, the job is gone.  
The answer is no.  
The door doesn’t open.  
And everything feels off track.

You panic.  
You grieve.  
You ask, “Why?”

But perhaps the better question is, **“What now?”**

Because here’s the truth:

If things don’t turn out as planned,  
It doesn’t mean they’ve failed.  
It could be that they are going better.  

Just not yet.  
Not in a way you can see.

That *“no”* might protect you.  
That delay might shape you.  
That U-turn might bring wonder.

Something bigger.  
Something bolder.  
Something more than you ever dared to hope for.

You also don’t need to know the complete path.  
You just need to stay open.  
Stay curious.  
Let go of the script.  
And **trust the plot twist**.

Sometimes, what doesn’t happen —  
That is the start of what will.
