### Your responsibilities
Key objectives include:
- Develop and test machine learning methods (e.g., topic modeling, LLMs) to detect journalistic perspectives in large datasets of news and social media.
- Collaborate closely with researchers in journalism and applied linguistics to identify systemic viewpoints in media coverage.
- Co-develop with media practice partners a prototype dashboard for integration into media monitoring tools.

This position is ideal for an early-career researcher aiming to advance their academic career with an interest in applications and collaborations with the private sector. The role also offers career development opportunities, including mentoring and gaining demonstrable experience and skills in teaching, research supervision, and securing research funding.
