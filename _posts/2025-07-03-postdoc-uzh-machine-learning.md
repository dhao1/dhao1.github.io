The appointed researcher will join a DIZH-funded project developing digital tools for media monitoring and discourse analysis. In collaboration with journalism and linguistics experts at ZHAW and practice-oriented media partners, the project combines journalism, complex systems theory, applied linguistics, and machine learning to analyze how different perspectives (e.g., scientific, political, legal, moral, economical) are linked in media coverage of issues like climate change, migration, energy or political voting in Switzerland. The goal is to measure and visualize how journalists frame complex topics.

### Your responsibilities
Key objectives include:
- Develop and test machine learning methods (e.g., topic modeling, LLMs) to detect journalistic perspectives in large datasets of news and social media.
- Collaborate closely with researchers in journalism and applied linguistics to identify systemic viewpoints in media coverage.
- Co-develop with media practice partners a prototype dashboard for integration into media monitoring tools.

This position is ideal for an early-career researcher aiming to advance their academic career with an interest in applications and collaborations with the private sector. The role also offers career development opportunities, including mentoring and gaining demonstrable experience and skills in teaching, research supervision, and securing research funding.

Your responsibilities:
- Lead and publish original research aligned with the project's objectives.
- Develop the web dashboard with the rest of the project's team.
- Contribute to the teaching and supervision of students at the DM3L.
- Actively participate in and contribute to Quantitative Network Research group research activities.
- Contribute to project funding applications within the group and apply for personal research funding (e.g., postdoctoral fellowships and grants).

### Your profile
- A completed PhD degree in a related field.
- Experience with peer-reviewed publications in international journals.
- Excellent organizational and communication skills.
- Strong programming and analytical skills, committed to open and reproducible research practices.
- Experience with machine learning/NLP approaches for analyzing large amount of textual data with a willingness to further develop these skills in the project context.
- Strong interpersonal and team collaboration skills.
- Fluency in spoken and written English.
- Knowledge of German is not required but would be an asset. Opportunities to learn German will be available during the appointment.

What will help you thrive in this role:
- Keen interest in critically evaluating machine learning methods and the integration into media monitoring and discourse analysis challenges
- Enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research and learning new methods
- Passionate about teaching and supervision
- Team-oriented and open to diverse backgrounds and perspectives
- Creative and analytical problem-solver
