# HAO DU you XIAO me?

Welcome to my digital home — a personal website for curious minds, open hearts, and creative souls.

The name of this site, **“HAO DU you XIAO me?”**, is a playful blend of English and Mandarin. It phonetically echoes the question:

> **“How do you know me?”**

But it’s also my name in plain sight — **HAO DU XIAO** — woven into the sentence.  
It’s a small linguistic riddle, and also a deeper question:  
**How do we come to know anyone?** Through words? Through stories? Through shared ideas?

Here’s the breakdown that inspired it:

| Word     | Chinese Character | English Meaning | Connection                                   |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **HAO**  | 郝                 | "How"            | Similar pronunciation (homophone in English) |
| **DU**   | 读                 | "Do"             | Similar pronunciation                        |
| **you**  | —                 | "You"            | Direct English word                          |
| **XIAO** | 晓                 | "Know"           | Same meaning in Chinese (晓 = to know)        |
| **me?**  | —                 | "Me?"            | Direct English                               |
